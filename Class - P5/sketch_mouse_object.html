write some eplanation here. One way to estimate strike and dip of a bed is using the three point problem. Since three points define a plane, it is possible to write the equation for any plane from three points (x,y,z) and calculate the stike and dip. The relative x coordinate (easting), y coordinate (northing) and z coordinate (elevation) for each point must be determined. The following example shows how these three coordinates are used to calculate strike and dip. Work through the example and use the approach to calculate stikes and dips for your own measurements.
